The information will be used to create two signers for the envelope. We add a PDF document to the envelope.<br><br>We set the current account owner's email and name as the first signer and set their <code>clientUserId</code> to 1, since they will use embedded signing.<br><br>We set the new account owner's phone number and name as the second signer.</p><h5>Step 2</h5>Using <a href=\"https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/tabs/auto-place/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">anchor positioning</a>, we add SignHere tabs for each signer, tabs that autofill the signers' full names, and data entry tabs for the new owner's account information.<br><br>We construct the tabs for each signer, add the recipients, and set the envelope status to <code>sent</code>.</p><h5>Step 3</h5>Using the <a href=\"https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/create/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Envelopes:create</a> method, we create and send the envelope to both signers: to the current account owner via embedded signing and to the new owner via SMS delivery. The returned <code>envelopeId</code> is stored for use in the next step.</p><h5>Step 4</h5>To enable embedded signing within the app, we call the <a href=\"https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopeviews/createrecipient/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EnvelopeViews:createRecipient</a> method with the <code>envelopeId</code> and a return URL to this application. This method generates a signing URL for the signer, to which the original owner is redirected.</p><h5>Step 5</h5>After both recipients sign the envelope, a copy of the completed envelope is sent to the new owner via SMS."
